# hello-world
The first repository done using GitHub.
One of the most significant changes I made in my life was to change my focus of making billions of dollars into solving problems that can help humanity. I understood that no matter how much money I make in the end, I wn't be able to take it to my next life ( Displaying the Rencarnation belief I possess). Better I will focus during this lifetime as Johan Arcos to obtain a superior consciousness and make a change in the world.
